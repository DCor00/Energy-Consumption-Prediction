# Energy Consumption Prediction and Forecasting

This repository contains a project developed for the **Master's Course in Artificial Intelligence for Science and Technology** at **University of Milano-Bicocca** (2024). The primary focus of the project is to predict and forecast energy consumption using various machine learning and data analysis techniques.

## Project Overview

The project aims to analyze energy consumption data and develop models capable of predicting future energy usage. This is critical for optimizing energy management, reducing costs, and minimizing environmental impacts. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation steps.

## Objectives

- Analyze historical energy consumption data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns and trends.
- Build predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
- Forecast future energy usage based on the learned patterns.
- Evaluate model performance and optimize prediction accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions, trends, and seasonality patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to enhance the predictive power of the models.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Neural Networks
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared are used to evaluate model performance.
- **Forecasting**: Time-series forecasting techniques to predict future energy consumption.

## Dataset 
GREEND is an energy dataset containing power measurements collected from multiple households in Austria and Italy. It provides detailed energy profiles on a per device basis with a sampling rate of 1 Hz.
